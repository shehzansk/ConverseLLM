    <b>ConverseLLM:</b> The all-in-one AI app you were looking for.<br />
    Chat with your docs, use AI Agents, hyper-configurable, multi-user, & no frustrating set up required.
</p>

A full-stack application that enables you to turn any document, resource, or piece of content into context that any LLM can use as references during chatting. This application allows you to pick and choose which LLM or Vector Database you want to use as well as supporting multi-user management and permissions.

### Product Overview

ConverseLLM is a full-stack application where you can use commercial off-the-shelf LLMs or popular open source LLMs and vectorDB solutions to build a private ChatGPT with no compromises that you can run locally as well as host remotely and be able to chat intelligently with any documents you provide it.

ConverseLLM divides your documents into objects called `workspaces`. A Workspace functions a lot like a thread, but with the addition of containerization of your documents. Workspaces can share documents, but they do not talk to each other so you can keep your context for each workspace clean.

### Technical Overview

This monorepo consists of three main sections:

- `frontend`: A viteJS + React frontend that you can run to easily create and manage all your content the LLM can use.
- `server`: A NodeJS express server to handle all the interactions and do all the vectorDB management and LLM interactions.
- `collector`: NodeJS express server that process and parses documents from the UI.
- `docker`: Docker instructions and build process + information for building from source.
- `embed`: Submodule for generation & creation of the [web embed widget]().
- `browser-extension`: Submodule for the [chrome browser extension]().

## How to setup for development

- `yarn setup` To fill in the required `.env` files you'll need in each of the application sections (from root of repo).
  - Go fill those out before proceeding. Ensure `server/.env.development` is filled or else things won't work right.
- `yarn dev:server` To boot the server locally (from root of repo).
- `yarn dev:frontend` To boot the frontend locally (from root of repo).
- `yarn dev:collector` To then run the document collector (from root of repo).
